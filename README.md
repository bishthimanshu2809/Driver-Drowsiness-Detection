# 🧠 Driver Drowsiness Detection System

An AI-powered real-time system that detects driver drowsiness using computer vision and deep learning. It monitors eye states through a webcam and triggers alerts when signs of fatigue are detected, helping reduce road accidents caused by driver sleepiness.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Driver fatigue is one of the leading causes of road accidents worldwide.  
This system uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify eye states as **open** or **closed**, and performs real-time detection using webcam input.

The project covers the complete ML pipeline:

- Data preprocessing  
- Model training  
- Evaluation  
- Real-time deployment
